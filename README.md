### The Story

Meet Ricky. Lately he prefers to spend a lot of time in his smartphone. There’s so much interesting there! Ricky has a watch, however adult reminders like “you need to stand for a minute” or “your goal is to walk 10000 steps today“ are so boring.

Kids love interactive games and they love music. 
So we made an app that engages them to move more by playing with a virtual character.

On his watch and on a big TV in his room Ricky has an app DanceForMusic. The watch is automatically paired with the TV. And the watch nudges him with a lovely character, who is asking him to dance together.

Then the game starts. The character is not very happy, but as soon as Ricky moves, it starts to dance with Ricky. The music starts playing too, first faintly but with each Ricky’s move it becomes more and more detailed. New musical instruments are introduced and sound louder.

The character is happy, and Ricky is happy too. But this is not the end, and a the character will surely nudge Ricky for a new different funny game very soon.

What game will it be? Perhaps, hunting for a treasure?

### TL;DR
We use movements to create new musical and interactive experiences. Using motion data from the the wrist sensors (or a phone in your hand), the app will gradually change a song in tune with your movements and make the character dance in different ways. It will engage the kids to try new moves and create new variants for songs.
